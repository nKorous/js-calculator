# Basic JS Calculator App

this project is written in plain old javascript and minimal HTML. It has the basic functions of a calculator (division, multiplication, subtraction, addition) as well as a history of equations that can be shown or hidden. There really isnt anything fancy going on here, it's just a basic calculator.
